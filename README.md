Chrome Tab Manager
==================

__Chrome Extension__
(requires [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome))

Install: http://goo.gl/Pi1jo 

### Problems

 * You keep tabs open as a reference for later, you are not actually using it at this moment.
 * A lot of tabs make it very hard to recover the tab you were looking for, because you only see a favicon.
 * A lot of tabs consume a lot of RAM and CPU.

### Solution

 * Show an overview of all tabs with favicon and title.
 * Save tab as a reference and close it ... and easily restore it later.  
   *(this is done by clicking the checkbox, see screenshot below)*

### TODOS

 * bug fixing
 * refactoring into classes
 * group domains together
 * drag & drop
 * usability tests for re-opening windows/tabs
 * refactor html (especially the right options div)
 * replace checkbox with some fancy icon
 * it takes about 500ms until the popup is opened. is this due to the chrome animations or a performance issue?
 * hotkey support
 * direct/global icon which saves the tab as reference. so i dont have to open the popup first.
 * translations
 * extension icon? and icons overall...
